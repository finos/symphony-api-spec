  title: Agent API
  description: |
    This document refers to Symphony API calls to send and receive messages
    and content. They need the on-premise Agent installed to perform
    decryption/encryption of content.

    - sessionToken and keyManagerToken can be obtained by calling the
    authenticationAPI on the symphony back end and the key manager
    respectively. Refer to the methods described in authenticatorAPI.yaml.
    - Actions are defined to be atomic, ie will succeed in their entirety
    or fail and have changed nothing.
    - If it returns a 40X status then it will have sent no message to any
    stream even if a request to aome subset of the requested streams
    would have succeeded.
    - If this contract cannot be met for any reason then this is an error
    and the response code will be 50X.
    - MessageML is a markup language for messages. See reference here:
    https://developers.symphony.com/documentation/message_format_reference

      description: |
          A datafeed provides the messages in all conversations that a user is in.
          This also includes system messages like new users joining a chatroom.

          A datafeed will expire if it isn't read before its capacity is reached.

      summary: Read a given datafeed.
      description: |
          Read messages from the given datafeed. If no more messages are available then this method will block.
          It is intended that the client should re-call this method as soon as it has processed the messages
          received in the previous call. If the client is able to consume messages more quickly than they become
          available then each call will initially block, there is no need to delay before re-calling this method.

          A datafeed will expire if its unread capacity is reached.
          A datafeed can only be consumed by one client thread at a time. E.g. polling the datafeed by two threads may lead to messages being delivered out of order.

        You may include an attachment on the message.

        The message can be provided as MessageMLV2 or PresentationML. Both formats support Freemarker templates.

        The optional parameter "data" can be used to provide a JSON payload containing entity data.
        If the message contains explicit references to entity data (in "data-entity-id" element attributes),
        this parameter is required.

        If the message is in MessageML and fails schema validation
        a client error results

        If the message is sent then 200 is returned.

        Regarding authentication, you must either use the sessionToken which was created for delegated app access
        or both the sessionToken and keyManagerToken together.
