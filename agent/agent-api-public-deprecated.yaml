        A caller can fetch all unseen messages by passing the timestamp of

        with the same timestamp value already seen as the skip parameter. This
        means that every message will be seen exactly once even in the case that
        an additional message is processed with the same timestamp as the last
        message returned by the previous call, and the case where there are
        more than maxMessages with the same timestamp value.

        This method is intended for historic queries and is generally reliable
        but if guaranteed delivery of every message in real time is required
        then the equivilent firehose method should be called.

        the last message seen as the since parameter and the number of messages
        with the same timestamp value already seen as the skip parameter. This
        means that every message will be seen exactly once even in the case that
        an additional message is processed with the same timestamp as the last
        message returned by the previous call, and the case where there are
        more than maxMessages with the same timestamp value.

        This method is intended for historic queries and is generally reliable
        but if guaranteed delivery of every message in real time is required
        then the equivilent firehose method should be called.
