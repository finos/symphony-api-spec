  title: Agent API
  description: |
    This document refers to Symphony API calls to send and receive messages
    and content. They need the on-premise Agent installed to perform
    decryption/encryption of content.

    - sessionToken and keyManagerToken can be obtained by calling the
    authenticationAPI on the symphony back end and the key manager
    respectively. Refer to the methods described in authenticatorAPI.yaml.
    - Actions are defined to be atomic, ie will succeed in their entirety
    or fail and have changed nothing.
    - If it returns a 40X status then it will have sent no message to any
    stream even if a request to some subset of the requested streams
    would have succeeded.
    - If this contract cannot be met for any reason then this is an error
    and the response code will be 50X.
    - MessageML is a markup language for messages. See reference here:
    https://rest-api.symphony.com/docs/messagemlv2
    - **Real Time Events**: The following events are returned when reading
    from a real time messages and events stream ("datafeed"). These
    events will be returned for datafeeds created with the v5 endpoints.
    To know more about the endpoints, refer to Create Messages/Events
    Stream and Read Messages/Events Stream. Unless otherwise specified,
    all events were added in 1.46.

        Sends a message to be imported into the system.
        Allows you to override the timestamp and author of the message with your desired values.
        The requesting user must have the Content Management role.
        The user that the message is intended to have come from must also be present in the conversation.
        The intended message timestamp must be a valid time from the past. It cannot be a future timestamp.
        Optionally the original message ID can be specified to identify the imported message for the purpose of repeat imports.

      summary: Post a message to multiple existing streams.
      description: |
        Post a new message to the given list of streams. The stream can be a chatroom,
        an IM or a multiparty IM.

        You may include an attachment on the message.

        The message can be provided as MessageMLV2 or PresentationML. Both formats support Freemarker templates.

        The optional parameter "data" can be used to provide a JSON payload containing entity data.
        If the message contains explicit references to entity data (in "data-entity-id" element attributes),
        this parameter is required.

        If the message is in MessageML and fails schema validation a client error results

        This endpoint is idempotent, it means that a 200 response will be returned even if the message has not been
        delivered to some streams. Check the `errors` map from the response in order to see on which stream(s) the
        message has not been delivered.

        The maximum number of streams where the message can be sent is limitted to 100.

        Regarding authentication, you must either use the sessionToken which was created for delegated app access
        or both the sessionToken and keyManagerToken together.

      summary: Get messages from an existing stream.
      description: |
        A caller can fetch all unseen messages by passing the timestamp of
        the last message seen as the since parameter and the number of messages
        with the same timestamp value already seen as the skip parameter. This
        means that every message will be seen exactly once even in the case that
        an additional message is processed with the same timestamp as the last
        message returned by the previous call, and the case where there are
        more than maxMessages with the same timestamp value.

        This method is intended for historic queries and is generally reliable
        but if guaranteed delivery of every message in real time is required
        then the equivilent firehose method should be called.

      summary: Post a message to one existing stream.
      description: |
        Post a new message to the given stream. The stream can be a chatroom,,an IM or a multiparty IM.

        You may include an attachment on the message.

        The message can be provided as MessageMLV2 or PresentationML. Both formats support Freemarker templates.

        The optional parameter "data" can be used to provide a JSON payload containing entity data.
        If the message contains explicit references to entity data (in "data-entity-id" element attributes),
        this parameter is required.

        If the message is in MessageML and fails schema validation a client error will be returned.

        If the message is sent then 200 is returned.

        Regarding authentication, you must either use the sessionToken which was created for delegated app access
        or both the sessionToken and keyManagerToken together.
